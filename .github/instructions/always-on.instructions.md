# Spec-driven Spring + Angular — always-on guardrails

You are working in a workspace that uses the spec-driven workflow defined in `docs/methodology.md`. These guardrails apply to **every** request, regardless of which chatmode is active.

## Read these on every session

- `docs/methodology.md` — the seven phases.
- `docs/harness-principles.md` — the agent validates its own work.
- `docs/artifact-contract.md` — `.specs/<feature-id>/` file layout.
- `docs/spec-format.md` — EARS-lite ACs and `Q-NNN` open questions.

## Hard rules — phases 1, 2, 3 (spec, spec-review, design + tasks)

- **Never invent.** No silent default for: DB engine, auth scheme, error envelope, pagination, units, currency, retention, etc.
- When you would otherwise pick a default, write a `Q-NNN` line in the active artifact's `## Open Questions` section and **halt** for the user.
- Quote source tickets verbatim — never paraphrase requirements.
- AC IDs (`AC-NNN`) and task IDs (`T-NNN`) are stable; never renumber.
- For Epic-sized work, produce high-level Epic artifacts first (`03-epic-design.md`, `03a-epic-roadmap.md`) before slice-level `03-design.md` and `04-tasks.md`.

## Hard rules — phase 4 (build)

- TDD only. **Never** edit `src/main/**` unless `.specs/<active-feature>/.tdd-state.json` shows `phase: red` with a non-empty `red_failure_excerpt` for the active task.
- Edit only files listed in the active task's `Files in scope` (in `04-tasks.md`).
- Never use `-DskipTests`, `-Dpit.skip`, `-Dcheckstyle.skip`, `-Dspotbugs.skip`, `--no-verify`.
- Never delete a test or remove an assertion.
- Never lower a coverage threshold.
- Never add `@Disabled` without a `# DisabledReason: <link>` comment on the line above.
- For frontend tasks (Angular), follow the same red→green→refactor→simplify discipline and never edit files outside `Files in scope`.

## Hard rules — phase 6 (validate) and phase 7 (review)

- Never modify production code or tests in these phases.
- A skipped test without `# DisabledReason` = error.
- A missing report for a configured layer = error.
- Every waiver references an ADR file.

## Commit permission rule (all phases)

- Never commit code automatically.
- Before running any `git commit`, ask the user for explicit permission for that specific commit.
- Commit permission is single-use. After one commit, ask again before any later commit.
- Prior consent in the same session does not grant blanket permission for future commits.

## Spring Boot 4 conventions

Apply `shared/skills/spring-boot-4-conventions/SKILL.md`:
- Constructor injection only (no `@Autowired` on fields).
- Package by feature/domain, not by layer (top-level packages are bounded contexts with `api/` as published surface; DTOs go in `api/dto/`; domain exceptions go in `api/exception/`; controllers go directly in `api/`; private impl in `model/`, `repository/`, `service/` sub-packages — use typed sub-packages when a feature has multiple classes of the same type; cross-cutting exception handler lives in `shared/exception/`).
- `@HttpExchange` / `RestClient` for outbound HTTP (no new `RestTemplate`).
- Records for DTOs.
- `@MockitoBean` (not deprecated `@MockBean`).
- Slice tests over `@SpringBootTest` whenever possible.
- **No Lombok** in any new code (use records and explicit constructors).

## Frontend conventions (Angular track)

Apply Angular-focused skills when the active task touches frontend files:
- Use standalone components and route-level code splitting where practical.
- Use typed API clients/contracts; avoid ad-hoc untyped HTTP response handling.
- Keep component templates accessible (labels, button semantics, keyboard reachability).
- Cover validation rules with unit/component tests; do not rely on manual QA only.

## Natural-language aliases

When the user types these phrases, treat them as the corresponding command:

| Phrase | Command |
|---|---|
| "simplify the code" / "make this clearer" / "remove the cleverness" | `/code-simplify` |
| "spec this" / "turn this ticket into requirements" | `/spec` |
| "review the spec" | `/spec-review` |
| "plan this epic" / "design this epic" / "slice this epic" | `/epic-plan` |
| "plan this" / "design this" / "break into tasks" | `/plan` |
| "implement T-NNN" / "build T-NNN" | `/build T-NNN` |
| "validate" / "run the harness" | `/validate` |
| "review the code" / "pre-commit review" | `/review` |
| "ship it" / "release this" / "prepare release" | `/ship` |
| "onboard this repo" | `/onboard` |

## Cross-platform parity

The same prompt across Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf must produce the same artifacts. If you ever need to depart from this, write an ADR explaining why.
